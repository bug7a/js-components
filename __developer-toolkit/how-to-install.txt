# How to Install Extensions from .vsix Files in Visual Studio Code

Installing a VS Code extension from a `.vsix` file is useful when you want to install an extension offline or from a local package. Here's how to do it:

---

1. Download the `.vsix` File

---

You should already have the `.vsix` file for the extension. This might be provided by a developer, built from source, or downloaded from a custom location.

2. Using the Command Palette (Recommended)

---

* Open Visual Studio Code
* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette
* Type `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` and select it
* Browse to the `.vsix` file on your computer and click **Open**
* VS Code will install the extension and prompt you to reload the window if needed

3. Using the Terminal

---

You can also use the command line if you have VS Code's CLI (`code`) set up:

```
code --install-extension path/to/your-extension.vsix
```

Replace `path/to/your-extension.vsix` with the actual path to your file.

4. Verifying the Installation

---

* Go to the **Extensions** panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
* Search for the extension name to confirm it is installed
* You can uninstall or disable it from the same panel

## Notes

* Some extensions may require reloading VS Code after installation
* Make sure the `.vsix` file matches your VS Code version and architecture
* You can uninstall using the command palette: `Extensions: Uninstall Extension`
